GoogleDork:       master.passwd
Description:      master.passwd


There's nothing that defines a googleDork more than getting your PASSWORDS grabbed by Google for the world to see. Truly the epitome of a googleDork. The hits in this search show "master.passwd" files which contain encrypted passwords which may look like this: "guest MMCHhvZ6ODgFo" A password cracker can eat cheesy hashes faster than Elvis eatin' jelly doughnuts. Bravo googleDorks! Good show!For master.passwd, be sure to check other files in the same directory...
